-1. Think more about how to model obligation
I think it *is* impt to be able to ask, not just whether it is __possible__ for org to notify affected before being told by PDPA not to do it, but also whether there is a scenario where the org is __required__ to notify the affected before subsequently being told that they must not notify.

OK but how to talk about obligation? 

Maybe:

* the DSL will translate obligation-talk (obligations should be one of the key domain concepts) to constraints that check, at the relevant deadlines (which can be based on time or based on other trigger events), whether the obligation has been met, and that transit to sanctions otherwise
* then when we need to check whether some actor is __obligated / required__ to do X by that deadline (i.e., whether X is an obligation), we can just use something like: is there a next state S' such that, if A does not do X by the deadline state, then A will be sanctioned in S' (in this use case, will move to OrgBrokeLaw state in S' / S' = OrgBrokeLaw)
* This would allow us to ask about obligations in our queries. And we'd be able to use the auxiliary relation trick to keep track in the visualizer of when specific obligations have been fulfilled or violated




0. Fix / check OrgNotifyAffectedIsForever and PDPCNotifyDecisionIsForever (write some examples / property tests)
1. Probably call State 'Time' instead of State
2. Experiment with putting the `next` field in State/time instead of the one sig Trace
3. Do the events / auxiliary relations thing from https://haslab.github.io/formal-software-design/modeling-tips/index.html#improved-visualisation-with-auxiliary-relations to make it clearer what transitions are taking place when!
4. Think more abt how i'm structuring the specification, esp. the traces stuff
5. Add more tests of the specification
6. Write up some tests of the system / properties + some run queries
7. Docs: Write up some docs; Collate simplifying / modelling choices / assumptions somewhere 
8. Do the temporal mode version

TO DO: Try the  Ray Reiter style of modelling as well! See Jackson Software Abstractions pg 197+

Notes re modelling approach
---------------------------

OK now that I've thought more about it, mutual exclusion is probably not the best analogy.
* Maybe one important difference is that in this context, the PDPC's decision always takes precedence over Org's, and so the usual, fairer solutions to synchronization won't really apply here. Also, it really dos not matter that PDPC can be in the CS at same time as Org, if PDPC always ends up making the same decision as Org re whether to notify.
* (Another, less impt difference is that here, we are assuming that once either PDPC or the Org gets into the CS --- i.e., once they decide to notify --- they don't ever leave.)



Notes re law
--------------
Re 
> on or after notifying the Commission under subsection (1), the organisation must also notify each affected individual affected by a notifiable data breach mentioned in section 26B(1)(a) in any manner that is reasonable in the circumstances.
There's a crucial difference between this and the req to notify the commission, in that there's no explicit deadline (though there's a vague 'reasonableness' req), whereas the org must notify the Commission no later than 3 days after org figures out that it's a notifiable data breach


Ideas
------
I think that this 'race condition' is a safety property: we only need a finite trace to get the counterexample


To think about
---------------
** Should we use temporal mode? prob best to try both and see how

* auxiliary relations for events, or just using a more events-based approach (where instead of writing a predicate for each operation, a signature is declared whose atoms represent a set of events)
    * see Raymond Reiter. The frame problem in the situation calculus: a simple solution (sometimes) and a completeness result for goal regression and [https://haslab.github.io/formal-software-design/modeling-tips/index.html#an-idiom-to-depict-events] 


[MAYBE] the message passing framework from the crypto case study might be a good way to conceptualize org notifying the PDPC and org notifying person


*/

abstract sig Actor {}
one sig PDPC, Org extends Actor {}
/* Modelling choices to think abt here: 

* I'm currently folding in Affected / Individual into the states instead of treating it as a separate actor to whom messages can be passed, but is that simplification OK?
* Is PDPC really on same ontological level as Org? Might make more sense to have separate sig for PDPC
* Might it be better to fold the PDPC stuff into the states?

======= How to model the state? =============
--- One way: something like

abstract sig WhetherToNotifyAffected {}
one sig NotifyAffected, PDPCSaysDoNotNotifyAffected extends WhetherToNotifyAffected {}

sig State {
    notifyStatus: func Actor -> WhetherToNotifyAffected,
}

--- Another way: use a very barebones main state sig and put the state info in the actor sub sigs 
sig TIME {
    next: lone TIME
}
...


--- Third way: really simplify and just have something like the following one sig states:
1. Initial
2. ThereIsNotifiableDB
3. ...?

Avishkar: distingusih between (i) comapny delibereately notifying individual despite receiving prohibition

Joe:
do a precondition check: when do not notify obligation comes into effect, 

two bool flags:
1. individual notified
2. do not notify indivdual
deadlock 

Martin: non-deadlock conception closer to how ppl think about it


I should finish up this model
see if what model checking results we can get out of it, how usefu lit is vis - a vis uppal

modelling of terminologies better in alloy than uppal
* an event is some sort of type, has x y z properties, possibly being triggered by somebody

had class definitions in baby L4 tht were ptu on hold, and that are similar to Alloy sigs
translating classes to Uppal difficult. So Alloy is useful target
